            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>I am Esther, an IT student who is passionate about technology and learning practical skills.
            I like working on real projects that solve real problems, not just theory.
            I have experience basic web development with HTMLand CSS and I am always trying to improve my skills. I am hardworking, motivated, and focused on building my future in tech. Even when things are challenging like applications, transcripts, or exams,I keep trying until I understand and succeed. I like learning step by step and I prefer clear and simple explanations. I am interested in opportunities that help me grow, such as training programs, internships, and tech communities. My goal is to become skilled, confident, and able to use technology to make a positive impact.</p>
